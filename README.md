### Our Sensing Ball will achieve these goals 
**CAPTURING HEIGHTENED SENSIVITY OF OUR ENVIRONMENT**
**Tactility**
-Capturing with different metrics, the effect of artificial and natural materials. To understand the partisipents hightened sensitivity through tactics and what is the difference between their perceptions and ours connected in the natural and built environment.
**Imaginations**
-Capturing how do we experience our built and natural environment through movements and bodies, with drawings generated by our movements.
To be able and imagine what we need in the spaces based on the generated drawings.
